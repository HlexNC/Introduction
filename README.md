I'm Hlex, and I'm currently 17 years old. I just wanted to give you all a quick (slow) introduction to myself. I hope you all accept me as a human.

At the moment, I am learning C# and Unity game dev for myself.  I was born in the US but live in Russia.  My dream ever since I was a child, as far as I can remember, I wanted to be a creator. I know it's unclear but hear me out. I got my first computer when I turned 9. I also got a game named Minecraft for my birthday. I started coding simple commands like /time set, /give, /tp &amp; etc. Later I started to create houses with multiple command blocks. After my parents saw my skills, I started to attend the coding course "Schools of programmers" (or "Школы программистов" in Russian). There I learned languages like C++, Python, Html, CSS, C#, and a bit of JS. At this moment, I am learning Industrial programming.

Industrial programming is not interesting for me, and I have been spending more and more time playing computer games, but sadly there is a low selection of good indie games, so I thought, why not start to create my games?

Because of Covid-19 (which is a blessing for me), I got a lot of free time on my hands. During that time, I learned a lot about Unity and even created 15 prototype games. Now I'm learning Blender3D, and it is a lot of fun.

My goals for life are to finish High school, enroll in a foreign university, and get a job as a developer or a programmer.
